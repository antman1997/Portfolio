          I am a 25 year old software developer who has a passion for coding.<br> I enjoy being
          creative and innovative. My goal in life is to become a game developer and the reason <br>
          I had chosen this career path is because there is an abundance of opportunity in the entertainment industry. <br>
          Most huge gaming companies seem to miss their market and fail to understand their consumer needs. <br>
          I aim to change that and develop something that people will enjoy.
